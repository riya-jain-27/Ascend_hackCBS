## Problem Statement
To streamline the process of providing financial assistance to students through CSR policies of well-established firms.

## Solution
We have developed a platform that bridges the gap between students needing scholarships or loans and the companies willing to help them. 

The process is favorable to students:
-> Hassle-free application filling only once
-> Reduced interest rates and chances for scholarships
-> Minimal and easy-to-understand UI

The company admins can choose the students based on their credit scores calculated by considering their educational, family, and economic background. The student applications are matched to the company programs based on the amount and interest of funds, which the admins can filter to choose appropriate candidates.

## WorkFlow of the web app:
1a. The user logs in as a student or a company through the options given on the landing page.
1b. If they are not already registered, the user must first sign up where they enter all the details to create their profile.
2a. The company admin will then be navigated to the dashboard, where all the student applications will be visible. On clicking on these applications, the admin will be able to see the details of the application, which they can accept or reject.
2b. The student will be navigated to their profile which they can update as and when they want.
